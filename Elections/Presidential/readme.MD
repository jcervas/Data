Notes:

- Colorado in 1876 did not hold a presidential election, but instead the legislature appointed the three electors to Hayes. I use the vote for governor held a month before the November presidential election as a proxy for the popular vote in Colorado in 1876. John L. Routt was the elected Republican governor who defeated Bela M. Hughes (14,154 to 13,316).
